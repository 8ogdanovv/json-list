## Overview

JSON List provides the following features:

- Fetch JSON data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.
- Display the fetched JSON data in a nested list format.
- Apply simple CSS styles to format and structure the content.

You can try out the live demo [here](https://vadym4che.github.io/json-list/).

The application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and organizes it into a nested HTML list, creating a clear and structured representation of the JSON data.

## Usage

1. Open the [live demo](https://vadym4che.github.io/json-list/).
2. Observe the fetched JSON data displayed in a structured list format.
3. The list is organized hierarchically with each level represented by different CSS styles.

This project is a basic example of how to fetch and display JSON data from an API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use it as a starting point for more complex projects involving JSON data manipulation.
